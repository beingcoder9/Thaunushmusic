I had developed a login webpage which consists of sign-up and profile page along with it. firstly it displays a login page where you can enter your details and log in..if you are not having an account then you can create an account by clicking on register...The register page is for new users.Here by entering the all details it creates an account for you and then you can log in now.After login, it redirects you to your profile page which consists of Your name. Here I used HTML,CSS for the front end part in which HTML for creating the webpage and css for styling it and PHP,SQL for the backend in which PHP is used to connect the database and web pages, and MYSQL is used to store the data,xamp is used for hosting.
